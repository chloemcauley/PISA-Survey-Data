# PISA Survey Data

## Dataset


This dataset contains a survey of the skills and knowledge the student's possess as they reach the end of their compulsory education. This survey investigates how well students are equipped for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took put in the survey which assesses reading, mathematics, and science representing 28 million 15 year olds, globally. Out of the 65 economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving, and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.


## Summary of Findings

In the exporation, I found that there were no differences in international grades between countries that had different statuses (OECD and non-OECD). The distribution of genders who took part in the survey were relatively similar. The mathematics, reading, and science grades between the two genders were quite similar. However, it was found that females had better grades for reading, had worse grades for mathematical subjects, but had the same grades for science subjects compared to their male counterparts. The majority of the students were native and they performed better in scientific subjects compared to first and second generation immigrants. However, for mathematics and reading, native and second generation immigrants had the same score. Whereas, first generation performed worse in these subjects, they may have struggled due to the language barrier. As these were very small changes, I decided only to concentrate on the student's environment and the affect it has on their grades. 

East Asian countries had the top grades for mathematics, science, and reading. This may be due to their attitudes towards school and the immense pressure they are under from their family for them to do well at school. They also may not truant as much as the countries who perform poorly and they may study their curriculum more than other countries too. However, more investigation should be done to confirm these conclusions. As I am interested in comparing countries and grades, I will display them in the explanatory presentation. 

Students learn best when they don't use their own procedures and follow the correct procedure, many of the cognitive activation techniques only improve grades if they are used often. Giving students a balance of presenting problems with no obvious solutions, in different contexts and when they apply their knowledge will produce higher grades. There is a strong correlation between a sense of belonging and grades, where students would have better grades when they feel less lonely, or they don't feel awkard at school. The students' attitude towards school has a big impact on grades too. When students feel like school prepares them for jobs or college, they will get better grades than those who don't. Since there are strong relationships between cognitive activation, sense of belonging, attitude towards school, and truancy I will include these in my presentation. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

I have already polished my graphs by including appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends in my exploratory analysis. Therefore, the only aspect I would need to change is to put a series of plots into subplots so it is easier for the audience to read. When the graphs are clustered together, I will remove the titles as they are self explanatory in the axis. I will also resize my plots so their dimensions would fit into the slide page.
